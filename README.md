# HTML TIME TABLE
**HTML offers a wide variety of options, one of them is creation of tables and properly alligned images. This is also achieved by the help of styling tools like CSS and others**
**This project is about the creting an academic timetable for an institution. the time table organises time durations and lessons through out the entire week.
**For my timetable to be both  responsive and  accessible table, i have considered some basic things for proper runing; such things inlude**
 * Use of proper html tags: this allows the  screen readers understand and translate content in the table   
 * ALT text for images; i have used alternative text that describes the screenshot of the timetabe i have uploaded just incase there is poor connection the user will be able to know what the imahe is about.
 * Proper use of colours: i have ensured that the colours i have used are visible and of good contrast allowing the user to read confidently and smothly through out the entire timetable.
 * Text readability: i have not ised too small fonts to allow the users see through the content of the timetable. this will ensure my timetable can be read by everybody.
 * Responsiveness is an essential  requirement when creating a webpage... this is because the website will be used by diffrent users with diffrent gadetry. I Have considerd  that and  i have develoloped the timetable in a way that it can be accessed by everone
